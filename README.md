# PLEASE READ THIS FIRST
Hello,
Thank you for taking a glimpse at my project for VR.

To introduce the project, the VR game was created for normally sighted people to experience people with a disability in vision. The project gives an opportunity for people to experience three main different signt disabilities (peripheral vision impariment, medium turbidity,and nonspecific visual impairment). With these disabilities, the gamer is able to play a maze game with the simulated disability. Through this experience, they will be able to learn more about what the actual experience with the disability is like. Every time the maze is complete, participants are free to test different modes of sight disabilities, so that they can get a sense of how hard it is to complete the maze with different sight disabilities.
